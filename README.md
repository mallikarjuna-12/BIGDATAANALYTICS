# Report: Ecommerce Analytics Project Workflow

## 1. Project Overview

This report outlines the structure and workflow of the **`Ecommerce_Analytics`** project developed in Python (Jupyter Notebook).  
The project performs **end-to-end analytics** on an e-commerce dataset to explore sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance indicators.

### Repository Details:
* **Name**: Ecommerce_Analytics  
* **Language**: Python / Jupyter Notebook  
* **Description**: Exploratory and descriptive analytics on an e-commerce transactions dataset.  
* **Activity**: The notebook processes, visualizes, and summarizes multiple analytical aspects—sales, customers, categories, seasonality, and RFM-based segmentation.  
* **Releases/Packages**: No formal releases; intended as a single analysis notebook.

## 2. Inferred Analysis Workflow

The notebook follows a clear data analytics pipeline from data ingestion to visualization and insight generation.  
Below is the sequence of operations inferred from the Python workflow.

1. **Data Import & Setup**  
   - Load raw CSV dataset into a pandas DataFrame.  
   - Import required Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, etc.).

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and duplicate records.  
   - Convert columns to appropriate data types (`datetime`, numeric).  
   - Derive new columns such as `Revenue = Quantity × Price`, `Month`, and `Week`.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize sales over time to detect growth and seasonality.  
   - Identify top-performing products, categories, and countries.  
   - Explore order volume and revenue distributions.

4. **Customer Analytics**  
   - Perform **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** to classify customer segments.  
   - Generate retention cohorts and customer lifetime value (CLV) estimations.  
   - Visualize repeat purchase behavior and churn patterns.

5. **Advanced Business Insights**  
   - Identify seasonal sales peaks (holidays, festivals).  
   - Conduct Pareto (80/20) analysis on product performance.  
   - Compare payment methods and delivery channels by order count and revenue.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**  
   - Create dynamic visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.  
   - Export summary tables (e.g., `top_products.csv`, `rfm_segments.csv`).  
   - Generate a final analytical report (`Ecommerce_Analytics_Report.pdf`).
